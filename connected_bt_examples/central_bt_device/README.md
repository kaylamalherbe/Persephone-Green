# Central Bluetooth Example  

This is example code for a connection-oriented communication in Bluetooth LE. 
It reads a byte array similar to one used when advertising connectionless 
packets.  

LED 1 will turn on when it is connected to the peripheral device.  

Code was tested between a Thingy52 (peripheral) and NRF52840DK (central).
